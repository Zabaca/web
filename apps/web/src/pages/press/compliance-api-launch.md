**GLENDORA, CA** - Zabaca today announced the launch of ComplianceAPI.ai, the first comprehensive API platform that gives AI agents instant access to real-time business compliance data across all 50 states. As AI assistants increasingly handle business formation, payroll, and tax compliance tasks, they've been forced to navigate hundreds of fragmented government websites and interpret complex, ever-changing regulations. ComplianceAPI.ai solves this with a single API that provides structured, actionable compliance data designed specifically for AI consumption.

Every day, AI agents attempt to help entrepreneurs start businesses, calculate payroll taxes, or determine multi-state compliance requirements - only to fail when faced with unstructured PDFs, broken government websites, and regulations that change without notice. This fragmentation costs U.S. businesses over $1.9 trillion annually in compliance overhead, with 40% of small businesses paying an average of $845 per year in tax penalties alone due to missed deadlines or calculation errors.

ComplianceAPI.ai transforms this chaos into clarity with simple API calls. When an AI agent needs to form an LLC in California, calculate payroll withholding for remote employees across multiple states, or check economic nexus thresholds for sales tax, it gets instant, accurate, actionable data. The platform monitors thousands of federal, state, and local sources for regulatory changes, ensuring AI agents always work with current information.

> "AI agents are revolutionizing how businesses operate, but they've been handicapped by the lack of structured compliance data. We're building the nervous system that lets AI handle real-world business tasks. Just as Stripe abstracted away payment complexity, we're abstracting away compliance complexity for the AI era."

> James Lee, Founder and CEO of Zabaca

The platform launches with comprehensive coverage of business formation requirements for all 50 states, federal and state tax calculations, multi-state payroll withholding intelligence, and economic nexus tracking. Early beta users report dramatic improvements in their AI agents' capabilities.

    "Our AI assistant can now form LLCs, calculate payroll taxes, and track compliance deadlines across all our clients' states - tasks that were literally impossible before ComplianceAPI.ai. We've reduced compliance errors to zero while cutting processing time by 95%."

ComplianceAPI.ai uses a simple REST API that returns structured JSON responses optimized for AI consumption. Developers can integrate the platform in minutes, with comprehensive documentation and SDKs available for all major programming languages. The platform's intelligence engine handles complex calculations like multi-state payroll tax withholding, economic nexus analysis, and deadline tracking, while the action layer enables document generation and form preparation.

Getting started is straightforward - developers sign up for an API key and immediately gain access to compliance data across all jurisdictions. The platform offers usage-based pricing starting at free for developers (100 calls/month), $99/month for startups (10,000 calls), and $499/month for growth companies (100,000 calls), with enterprise plans available for high-volume users.

    "Within one week of integrating ComplianceAPI.ai, our AI agents successfully formed over 200 LLCs across 15 different states with zero errors. What used to take our human operators hours of research now happens instantly. It's not just a time saver - it's enabling entirely new AI capabilities we couldn't offer before."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly does ComplianceAPI.ai do?
ComplianceAPI.ai provides a single API that gives AI agents instant access to all U.S. business compliance data - from forming LLCs to calculating payroll taxes to tracking multi-state obligations. Instead of scraping government websites or parsing PDFs, your AI can make simple API calls to get structured, current, actionable compliance information.

### What types of compliance data are available?
At launch, we cover:
- Business formation requirements (all 50 states, all entity types)
- Payroll tax calculations (federal, state, and local withholding)
- Multi-state tax obligations and economic nexus rules
- Employment law requirements by location
- Business licensing and permit requirements
- Compliance deadlines and filing requirements

We're adding new data categories monthly based on developer needs.

### How current is the data?
Our monitoring systems check thousands of government sources daily for changes. When a tax rate changes or a new law takes effect, our data updates within 24 hours. Critical changes (like new tax rates) are typically updated within 2-4 hours of official publication. Every API response includes a `last_updated` timestamp so you always know data freshness.

### How accurate are the calculations?
Our calculation engines are tested against millions of real-world scenarios and validated by tax professionals. For payroll calculations, we maintain 99.9%+ accuracy compared to professional payroll services. All calculations include detailed breakdowns so you can verify the logic. We also maintain an audit trail of all calculations for compliance purposes.

### What's the pricing model?
We use simple usage-based pricing:
- Developer: Free (100 API calls/month)
- Startup: $99/month (10,000 calls)
- Growth: $499/month (100,000 calls)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing for high volume

Additional premium modules like advanced payroll calculations (+$49/month) and multi-state tracking (+$99/month) are available as add-ons.

### How do I get started?
Sign up at complianceapi.ai to get your API key instantly. We provide comprehensive documentation, code examples in all major languages, and SDKs for quick integration. Most developers have their first API call working within 10 minutes. No complex onboarding or sales calls required.
