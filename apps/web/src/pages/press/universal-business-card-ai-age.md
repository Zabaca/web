</div>

**GLENDORA, CA** - Zabaca today announced the launch of its revolutionary platform, the first universal discovery solution that makes any business instantly accessible to AI agents worldwide. For businesses struggling to connect with the rapidly growing AI agent ecosystem, Zabaca provides a simple vanity URL (zabaca.com/yourbusiness) that exposes their services - scheduling, payments, support, and more - to millions of AI assistants with just a few clicks.

Today, when an AI agent needs to schedule a meeting with a consultant, pay an invoice, or access customer support, there's no standard way to discover which services that business has made available. Businesses invest in tools like Calendly, Stripe, and Intercom, but these remain siloed and invisible to the AI agents that increasingly handle tasks for busy professionals. This fragmentation means lost opportunities - AI assistants that could be booking meetings, processing payments, or answering customer questions are instead hitting dead ends.

Zabaca solves this with the simplicity of a vanity URL. Business owners connect their existing services through one-click OAuth integrations, toggle which services to make AI-accessible, and immediately receive their Zabaca profile. AI agents can then discover and interact with these services through standardized APIs, turning what was once impossible into a seamless automated workflow. Just as the Yellow Pages made businesses discoverable to humans, Zabaca makes businesses discoverable to AI.

> "We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how business gets done - AI agents are becoming the primary interface for routine business interactions. Yet there's been no simple way for millions of small and medium businesses to participate in this AI-first economy. We're changing that by making AI accessibility as simple as claiming a social media handle."
>
> James Lee, Founder and CEO of Zabaca

Getting started with Zabaca takes less than five minutes. Business owners sign up, connect their existing tools like Cal.com or Stripe through secure OAuth, choose their vanity URL, and they're live. No coding, no complex integrations - just immediate AI accessibility for their business services.

    "Within 24 hours of setting up my Zabaca profile, I had AI assistants booking consultations directly into my calendar. It's like having a universal API for my entire business that just works with every AI platform. I'm getting bookings from AI agents I didn't even know existed."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly does Zabaca do?
Zabaca gives your business a simple vanity URL (like zabaca.com/yourbusiness) that AI agents can use to discover and interact with your services. It's like a business card that AI assistants can read and act upon - booking meetings, processing payments, accessing your knowledge base, or creating support tickets.

### How much does it cost?
Basic profiles are free forever, allowing AI agents to discover your business and access the services you've connected. Premium plans start at $19/month and include custom vanity URLs, detailed analytics showing which AI agents interact with your business, priority placement in search results, and advanced profile customization options.

### How is this different from having a website?
Websites and Linktree are designed for human visitors - they display information visually. Zabaca is built specifically for AI agents to programmatically discover and interact with your services. While humans see links, AI agents see standardized APIs they can actually use to book meetings, process payments, or access information automatically.

### What services can I connect?
Currently, we support popular business tools including Cal.com, Calendly, Stripe, Square, Intercom, Zendesk, Notion, and Google Workspace. We're adding new integrations weekly based on user requests. Each service you connect becomes immediately accessible to AI agents through our standardized API layer.

### Is my data secure?
Absolutely. We use OAuth for all service connections, meaning we never see your passwords. All API interactions are logged for your review, you control exactly which services are AI-accessible, and you can revoke access anytime. We're SOC 2 compliant and GDPR ready, with end-to-end encryption for all data transmission.
