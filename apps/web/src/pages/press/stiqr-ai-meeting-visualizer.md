**LOS ANGELES, CA** - Today we announced Stiqr, an AI-powered meeting assistant that automatically joins virtual meetings and transforms conversations into live visual diagrams, charts, and workflows. For teams who struggle to keep up with complex discussions and lose valuable insights in walls of text, Stiqr provides instant visual clarity by generating interactive whiteboards that evolve with your conversation.

During virtual meetings, critical ideas often get lost in rapid discussions. Team members scramble to sketch diagrams while missing important points, or worse, complex concepts remain abstract and misunderstood. Studies show that 65% of people are visual learners, yet most meetings remain purely verbal, creating a fundamental mismatch between how we communicate and how we best understand information.

Stiqr solves this by joining your Zoom or Google Meet calls as an intelligent participant. As your team discusses system architectures, data trends, or process flows, Stiqr instantly generates professional visualizations on a shared infinite whiteboard. When someone says "our API routes requests to three microservices," a system diagram appears. Mention that "Q4 sales are up 30% on mobile," and a chart materializes. Every visualization is interactive, editable, and saved as reusable components.

> "Stiqr represents a fundamental shift in how teams collaborate visually. We're not just recording meetings or transcribing them - we're amplifying human intelligence by turning abstract discussions into concrete visual understanding, all at the speed of conversation."
>
> Jae and James, Co-founders of Stiqr

Getting started with Stiqr is simple. Install our meeting bot, invite it to your next call, and watch as your ideas take shape automatically. No manual prompting or screen sharing required.

    "Stiqr transformed our architecture reviews completely. What used to take hours of post-meeting documentation now happens live. Our engineers can focus on problem-solving instead of frantically sketching diagrams."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly does Stiqr do?
Stiqr is an AI assistant that joins your virtual meetings and automatically creates visual diagrams, charts, and flowcharts based on your conversation. As you discuss ideas, it generates interactive visualizations on a shared whiteboard in real-time.

### How much does it cost?
Stiqr offers three tiers: Starter ($30/user/month) for small teams with basic diagrams, Professional ($50/user/month) with advanced visualizations and integrations, and Enterprise (custom pricing) with security features and dedicated support. All plans include a 14-day free trial.

### How is this different from Miro, FigJam, or other whiteboard tools?
Unlike traditional whiteboards that require manual drawing or prompting, Stiqr works autonomously. You don't need to stop your discussion to create visuals - they appear automatically as you speak. It's like having a graphic facilitator in every meeting, but powered by AI.

### When will Stiqr be available?
Stiqr is available now for Zoom and Google Meet, with Microsoft Teams support coming in Q1 2025. Sign up at stiqr.zabaca.com to start your free trial immediately.

### What are the system requirements?
Stiqr works with any device that can run Zoom or Google Meet. The visualizations display in any modern web browser. No special software installation required for viewers - only the meeting organizer needs to authorize the bot.

### Is our meeting data secure?
Yes. Stiqr is SOC 2 certified and uses end-to-end encryption. Visualizations are only accessible to meeting participants, and all data is deleted after 90 days unless you choose to save it. Enterprise customers can opt for on-premise deployment.
