**GLENDORA, CA** - Today we announce TemporalBridge, the first universal AI memory system that transforms developer conversations with any coding agent into persistent, searchable knowledge graphs, eliminating the devastating knowledge loss that costs the software industry $650 billion annually. For development teams drowning in documentation debt, context switching penalties, and institutional amnesia, TemporalBridge provides seamless knowledge continuity that turns every AI coding conversation into part of a larger, evolving understanding.

The software development industry faces an unprecedented knowledge management crisis. Teams lose 21% of their time to poor documentation, developers spend 40% longer resolving incidents due to missing system context, and new team members take 3-6 months to become productive instead of weeks. Most critically, AI coding assistants—from Claude Code to GitHub Copilot to Cursor—all suffer from complete "session amnesia," forcing developers to re-explain project context repeatedly across different tools, wasting 23% of coding time on manual context re-establishment.

TemporalBridge automatically captures conversations from any AI coding agent and stores them in Zep's temporal knowledge graphs, building rich relationships between concepts, technical decisions, and implementation details. The system intelligently processes both short messages and long technical content, extracting entities and relationships while preserving full conversation context. Developers can instantly search their accumulated knowledge using natural language queries, finding connections between past solutions and current challenges—regardless of which AI tool originally provided the solution.

> "We're attacking the root cause of developer productivity loss across the entire AI coding ecosystem. Whether you're using Claude Code for architecture decisions, Copilot for code completion, or Cursor for refactoring, that institutional knowledge disappears between sessions. TemporalBridge makes all AI-assisted development permanently searchable and builds unified memory that gets smarter over time."

Getting started works with any AI coding agent through universal integration patterns. TemporalBridge immediately begins building your team's knowledge graph from every AI conversation, creating searchable relationships between technologies, decisions, and problem-solving approaches across all your development tools. The system works invisibly in the background while providing powerful search capabilities through simple commands like `deno task search --query "debugging approaches"`.

    "Before TemporalBridge, our team's AI-assisted solutions were scattered across different tools with no continuity. I might solve a complex database optimization with Claude Code on Monday, then forget the approach when working with Copilot on Friday. Now I can instantly find how we solved similar problems across any AI tool, complete with the technical reasoning and alternative approaches we considered. Our 'archaeological debugging' time has dropped by 60%."

TemporalBridge is available now as an open-source project with initial Claude Code integration and universal adapter patterns for any AI coding agent. The system leverages Zep's enterprise-grade knowledge graph infrastructure while maintaining complete data privacy and control.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly does TemporalBridge solve?
TemporalBridge eliminates the knowledge management crisis that costs development teams billions annually. It automatically captures and organizes conversations from any AI coding agent (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) into searchable knowledge graphs, so technical decisions, problem-solving approaches, and system context never get lost between tools or forgotten over time.

### Which AI coding tools does it support?
TemporalBridge launches with Claude Code integration and provides universal adapter patterns for any AI coding agent. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other major tools are planned for Q4 2025. The open-source architecture allows community contributions for any AI tool integration.

### How much does it cost?
TemporalBridge is completely open-source and free to use. You only need a Zep API key (starting at $10/month for the hosted service, or self-hostable). No subscription fees, no per-user costs, no vendor lock-in. Works with whatever AI coding tools you're already paying for.

### How is this different from documentation tools?
Traditional documentation tools like Notion or Confluence require manual maintenance and become stale immediately. TemporalBridge automatically captures knowledge from actual AI-assisted development conversations across all your tools, builds relationships between concepts, and stays current with zero manual effort. It's the difference between hoping developers update docs versus automatically preserving every AI interaction.

### Can I search across conversations from different AI tools?
Yes, that's TemporalBridge's core value proposition. You can search for "authentication patterns" and find relevant solutions whether they came from Claude Code architectural discussions, Copilot code generations, or Cursor refactoring sessions. The knowledge graph unifies insights across your entire AI toolkit.

### What are the system requirements?
Requires Deno runtime, at least one supported AI coding agent, and a Zep API key. Works on any system where modern AI coding tools run. Integration setup varies by tool but typically takes under 10 minutes and works with existing development workflows without changes.

### Does this work with teams or just individual developers?
TemporalBridge captures knowledge per developer but can be configured for team-wide knowledge sharing. Teams can share Zep instances to build collective memory across all AI tools, or use individual instances for personal cross-tool knowledge management.
