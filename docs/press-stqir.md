## stiqr: Your AI Meeting Visualizer That Draws Ideas in Real-Time

**LOS ANGELES, CA** - Today we announced stiqr, an AI-powered meeting assistant that automatically joins virtual meetings and transforms conversations into live visual diagrams, charts, and workflows. For teams who struggle to keep up with complex discussions and lose valuable insights in walls of text, stiqr provides instant visual clarity by generating interactive whiteboards that evolve with your conversation.

During virtual meetings, critical ideas often get lost in rapid discussions. Team members scramble to sketch diagrams while missing important points, or worse, complex concepts remain abstract and misunderstood. Studies show that 65% of people are visual learners, yet most meetings remain purely verbal, creating a fundamental mismatch between how we communicate and how we best understand information.

stiqr solves this by joining your Zoom or Google Meet calls as an intelligent participant. As your team discusses system architectures, data trends, or process flows, stiqr instantly generates professional visualizations on a shared infinite whiteboard. When someone says "our API routes requests to three microservices," a system diagram appears. Mention that "Q4 sales are up 30% on mobile," and a chart materializes. Every visualization is interactive, editable, and saved as reusable components.

"stiqr represents a fundamental shift in how teams collaborate visually," said Jae and James, co-founders from Los Angeles, CA. "We're not just recording meetings or transcribing them - we're amplifying human intelligence by turning abstract discussions into concrete visual understanding, all at the speed of conversation."

Getting started with stiqr is simple. Install our meeting bot, invite it to your next call, and watch as your ideas take shape automatically. No manual prompting or screen sharing required.

"stiqr transformed our architecture reviews completely," said Marcus Rodriguez, CTO at TechCorp. "What used to take hours of post-meeting documentation now happens live. Our engineers can focus on problem-solving instead of frantically sketching diagrams."

stiqr is available now with a 14-day free trial. For more information and to see live demos, visit www.stiqr.ai.

## FAQ

### External FAQ (Customer-Focused)

**Q: What exactly does stiqr do?**
A: stiqr is an AI assistant that joins your virtual meetings and automatically creates visual diagrams, charts, and flowcharts based on your conversation. As you discuss ideas, it generates interactive visualizations on a shared whiteboard in real-time.

**Q: How much does stiqr cost?**
A: stiqr offers three tiers: Starter ($30/user/month) for small teams with basic diagrams, Professional ($50/user/month) with advanced visualizations and integrations, and Enterprise (custom pricing) with security features and dedicated support. All plans include a 14-day free trial.

**Q: How is this different from Miro, FigJam, or other whiteboard tools?**
A: Unlike traditional whiteboards that require manual drawing or prompting, stiqr works autonomously. You don't need to stop your discussion to create visuals - they appear automatically as you speak. It's like having a graphic facilitator in every meeting, but powered by AI.

**Q: When will stiqr be available?**
A: stiqr is available now for Zoom and Google Meet, with Microsoft Teams support coming in Q1 2025. Sign up at www.stiqr.ai to start your free trial immediately.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**
A: stiqr works with any device that can run Zoom or Google Meet. The visualizations display in any modern web browser. No special software installation required for viewers - only the meeting organizer needs to authorize the bot.

**Q: Is our meeting data secure?**
A: Yes. stiqr is SOC 2 certified and uses end-to-end encryption. Visualizations are only accessible to meeting participants, and all data is deleted after 90 days unless you choose to save it. Enterprise customers can opt for on-premise deployment.

### Internal FAQ (Stakeholder-Focused)

**Q: Why should we build this now?**
A: Three converging factors create a unique window: (1) LLMs have reached the quality needed for accurate context understanding, (2) The shift to remote work has made visual collaboration critical, with the virtual meeting market growing 15% annually, and (3) Fast inference services like Cerebras enable real-time code generation at 2000+ tokens/second.

**Q: What are the revenue projections?**
A: Conservative projections show $2M ARR in Year 1, $15M in Year 2, and $50M in Year 3. Based on Fireflies' growth trajectory (0 to $5M ARR in 24 months), but with 2.5x higher pricing due to increased value and compute costs. Target 10,000 paid organizations by Year 3.

**Q: What resources do we need?**
A: Initial team of 12: 4 engineers (LLM/backend), 2 ML engineers (visualization models), 2 frontend engineers (whiteboard interface), 1 designer, 1 product manager, 2 sales. $3M seed funding for 18 months runway, with Series A targeted at 1,000 customers.

**Q: What are the main risks?**
A: Technical: Accuracy of visualization generation (mitigated by starting with technical meetings). Market: Competition from meeting platforms adding native features (mitigated by being the visual layer for all platforms). Adoption: Security concerns about AI in meetings (mitigated by enterprise security features and on-prem options).

**Q: How does this align with our company strategy?**
A: stiqr positions us at the intersection of three massive trends: AI transformation ($200B market by 2025), visual collaboration ($5B market), and meeting intelligence ($3B market). It creates a defensible moat through proprietary visualization components and organizational knowledge graphs.

**Q: What are the key dependencies?**
A: Critical dependencies include: LLM API stability and pricing, meeting platform API access (Zoom, Google, Microsoft), real-time inference infrastructure, and component management system (Bit.dev). All have been validated with POCs.

**Q: How will we measure success?**
A: Primary metrics: Visualization accuracy rate (target 85%+), monthly active organizations (target 1,000 by Month 12), net revenue retention (target 120%+), and average visualizations per meeting (target 5+). Leading indicators include trial-to-paid conversion (target 25%+) and daily active usage rate (target 60%+).
